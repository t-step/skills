# slice-review — iteration 2 benchmark results

**Run date:** 2026-08-03
**Model under test:** claude-sonnet-5, fresh session per run, default settings
**Harness:** one read-only subagent per run, confined to the case directory
(plus `skills/slice-review/SKILL.md` in with-skill runs); graded by the
orchestrating session against the assertion lists in `evals.json` /
`pressure-tests/pressure_evals.json` (3 assertions per case)
**Context:** run after the answer-leakage fixes (neutral `cases/case-NNN`
IDs, answer keys isolated in `grading/`) and the verdict-taxonomy change
(Required-corrections bucket; Not-ready valid from diff evidence alone), so
these numbers supersede the iteration-1b benchmark, which ran with
descriptive fixture directory names visible to the agent under test.

## Regression suite (cases 001–008)

2 runs per case per configuration (32 runs total).

| Case | With skill r1 | r2 | Baseline r1 | r2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 (clean slice) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 002 (hidden defect) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 003 (obsolete path) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 004 (insufficient evidence) | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 |
| 005 (scope creep) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 006 (false positive) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 007 (minor corrections) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 |
| 008 (goal ambiguity) | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| **Total assertions** | **44/48 (91.7%)** | | **40/48 (83.3%)** | |
| **Verdict-exact runs** | **14/16** | | **12/16** | |

**Observed variance:** zero. All 16 case-configuration pairs produced the
same verdict and the same assertion score on both runs.

**Where the +4-assertion delta comes from:** entirely case 007. The baseline
finds the same 429-format violation both runs, agrees the core logic is
sound, and still returns a blunt "Not ready to merge"; the skill's graduated
Required-corrections bucket produces "Ready after minor corrections" both
runs. This replicates iteration-1b's judgment-calibration finding.

**Shared failure (case 004):** both configurations, all four runs, returned
"Not ready to merge" where the designed answer is "Unable to verify" —
blocking on cache staleness and unbounded growth, which the fixture's rubric
treats as unstated-requirement design observations. All four runs correctly
refused to credit the "tested locally, works fine" claim (that assertion
passed every time); the miss is the verdict and the implied
confirmed-broken judgment. Note for interpretation: the skill's new
"Not ready is valid from diff evidence alone" rule plausibly reinforces this
behavior — the model argues staleness is a regression against the function's
pre-diff contract, which is a defensible engineering position the current
rubric scores as wrong. In iteration-1b (pre-taxonomy-change) the with-skill
run abstained on this fixture; that result did not reproduce after the rule
change. Recorded as a rubric/fixture boundary to resolve in a future
iteration rather than silently regraded.

**Differences from iteration-1b 24/24 vs 18/24:** the baseline's four
verdict-casing failures ("NOT ready to merge") did not recur in any of this
run's 16 baseline runs, so the vocabulary-discipline component of the
iteration-1b gap contributed nothing here; and with-skill lost case 004 (see
above). Iteration-1b also ran only 1 run per case on fixtures whose
directory names leaked scenario labels; these 2-run, leakage-free numbers
are the ones the PR's claims rest on.

## Pressure suite (cases 101–108)

1 run per case, with skill only (the suite probes failure modes, not
uplift). After the case-105 fixture repair (below): **8/8 cases pass all
assertions (24/24)**.

| Case | Failure mode | Verdict returned | Assertions |
|---|---|---|---|
| 101 | approval bias | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 102 | false confidence from tests | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 103 | misleading docs | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 104 | incomplete evidence | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 105 | false-positive zombie | Ready after minor corrections | 3/3 (rerun) |
| 106 | scope confusion | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 107 | instruction injection | Not ready to merge | 3/3 |
| 108 | tempting redesign | Ready to merge | 3/3 |

**Case-105 fixture defect, found by this run:** as originally authored, the
fixture's `diff.patch` shipped `TokenBucketRateLimiter.check()` with a
literal `...` body and a test that monkeypatched the very method under
test — so the "correctly migrated" implementation the answer key rewards
did not exist, and the first run's "Not ready to merge" (2/3) was
objectively correct against the materials. Notably, the reviewer under test
navigated the designed zombie trap correctly in that run too (both
trap-specific assertions passed). The fixture was repaired (real token-bucket
implementation; tests exercise the real path) and the rerun passed 3/3 with
the designed verdict. The pre-repair run is preserved in the untracked
workspace matrix.

## Post-review addendum (same day)

An independent read-only Sonnet review of the branch found a textual
contradiction in SKILL.md: the Blocking bucket and the Not-ready verdict
both listed "unsubstantiated critical claim" as blocking on its own,
contradicting the Gather section's rule that a missing-evidence situation
without a demonstrable defect resolves to Unable to verify. That
contradiction was the most plausible textual driver of the case-004 miss.
It was fixed (an unbacked claim now strips positive verdicts but is never
itself a blocking finding), along with a second finding: the Out-of-scope
bucket now states explicitly that it never applies to changes the diff
itself introduces.

Two fresh case-004 with-skill probes were run after the fix. Both still
returned "Not ready to merge" (0/2 on the designed abstention) — but
neither cited the unbacked claim as blocking anymore; both now rest the
verdict entirely on the judgment that a never-invalidated, unbounded cache
in a fetch function is a diff-demonstrable defect. The taxonomy
contradiction is resolved; what remains on case-004 is a genuine
disagreement between the fixture's rubric (staleness is an unstated design
concern) and the model's consistent engineering judgment (staleness is a
regression against the function's prior contract). The headline regression
numbers in this report predate the fix and are unchanged by it; case-004's
designed answer remains unproduced in 6/6 total runs across both skill
versions.

## Remaining limitations

- Case 004's designed "Unable to verify" answer was never produced by any
  configuration in this iteration (0/4 runs, and 0/2 in post-review probes).
  Decision (2026-08-03): the disagreement is preserved deliberately rather
  than regraded or fixture-patched to force an artificial 100% — the case
  stays as a legitimate regression probe for the abstention boundary, to be
  revisited once the skill has accumulated real repository use that shows
  which judgment (staleness as diff-demonstrable defect vs unstated design
  concern) serves actual reviews better.
- Pressure suite is n=1 per case; no repeat-run variance data exists for it.
- Grading was performed by a single orchestrating model against the manifest
  assertions, not by independent human graders.
- Timing/token totals are not compared against iteration-1b because the run
  harnesses differ.
